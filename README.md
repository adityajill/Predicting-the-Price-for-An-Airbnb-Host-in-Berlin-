In this project:

I Worked on Airbnb Data to predict a spot-on daily price for a new accommodation that fits into its specific market environment and competitors in Berlin.

Analyzed and uncovered trends by EDA on different features. Extracted the required missing features from the description using text processing (NLP) to increase the accuracy. 

Found the Spot-on price what a new host can expect from his place.
